# Reverse Engineering Motherboard

## 1. Challenges of Using Flatbed Scanners for PCB Reverse Engineering

Many articles on reverse engineering PCBs suggest starting with a flatbed scanner to capture images of the board. However, if you are trying to understand a PCB with components, flatbed scanners may not be the best option.

The primary issue is that flatbed scanners focus on objects that are directly in contact with the scanner bed, losing focus on parts that are slightly elevated. This shallow depth of field means that components, which are not perfectly flat, appear blurry and indistinct in the scanned image. As a result, itâ€™s difficult to get a clear, detailed view of the PCB and its components using this method.

For those aiming to reverse engineer a PCB with components, alternative approaches may be more effective.

## 2. Picture

After putting a few hours of effort, I found a way to take a good picture of the motherboard PCB. I used an iPhone 15 camera and tried various angles and finally settled with the best picture I can do. You can use the magnifier app in iOS to find the part numbers of each component.
